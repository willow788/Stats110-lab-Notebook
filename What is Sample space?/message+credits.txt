hi!
I wrote the main code and did the basic visualisation but it looked so lame and bland, that i told copilot to make it more visually appealing.
also copilot fixed one minor indentation error.
so credits where it's due!
that's all 
do we need an handwritten explanation of what sample space or pebble world is?
idk let's see, depend on my energy level
thnks!
bye!

additional yap
an another thing, currently i'm studying gaussian distributive function in stats 110.
you see i'm not totally a beginner who's just learning what sample space is?
its just i got the idea of this lab notebook ... like 30 minutes ago so yeah
that why, i thought lets start from scratch
also its my first time coding probabililty concepts, i mostly work with models but i never coded any probability functn, this is like extreme stratch, its may feel a bit overwhelming later, but its really fun to implement these codes

that's all! 
thnks!
