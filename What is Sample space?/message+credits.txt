hi!
I wrote the main code and did the basic visualisation but it looked so lame and bland, that i told copilot to make it more visually appealing.
also copilot fixed one minor indentation error.
so credits where it's due!
that's all 
do we need an handwritten explanation of what sample space or pebble world is?
idk let's see, depend on my energy level
thnks!
bye!
