## 🌟 About This Project

Welcome to my **Stats 110 Lab Notebook**! This repository serves as my personal computational laboratory where I bridge the gap between statistical theory and practical implementation. Every concept I learn in my Statistics 110 class is brought to life through Python code, helping me solidify my understanding and create a valuable reference for the future.

> **"In mathematics, you don't understand things. You just get used to them."** — John von Neumann
> 
> This notebook is my way of truly understanding statistics by *doing* it.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- 📝 **Document** every statistical concept learned in Stats 110
- 💻 **Implement** theoretical ideas with clean, readable Python code
- 🧠 **Deepen** understanding through hands-on experimentation
- 📚 **Build** a comprehensive reference for future learning
- 🔄 **Connect** mathematical theory with computational practice

## 📖 Concepts Covered

### ✅ Currently Implemented

| Concept | Description | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| 🎲 **Sample Space** | Fundamental probability spaces and event modeling | ✅ Complete |

### 🚧 Coming Soon

As I progress through Stats 110, this section will expand to include: 

- 🎯 Probability axioms and rules
- 🔢 Counting principles (permutations & combinations)
- 🎪 Conditional probability and Bayes' theorem
- 📊 Random variables (discrete & continuous)
- 📈 Common probability distributions
- 🎰 Expectation and variance
- 🔗 Joint distributions and independence
- 📉 Limit theorems (Law of Large Numbers, Central Limit Theorem)
- 🧮 Statistical inference basics
- *... and much more!*

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Python 3.7 or higher recommended
python --version
```

### Installation

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/willow788/Stats110-lab-Notebook.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd Stats110-lab-Notebook

# Install required packages (if any)
pip install -r requirements. txt
```

### Usage

Each concept is organized in its own module or notebook for easy navigation:

```python
# Example: Exploring sample space
from sample_space import *

# Run examples and experiments
# (Specific usage will be documented in each module)
```

## 🎓 Learning Philosophy

This notebook follows a **learn-by-doing** approach: 

1. 📚 **Learn** a concept in Stats 110 class
2. 💡 **Understand** the mathematical foundation
3. 💻 **Implement** the concept in Python
4. 🧪 **Experiment** with examples and edge cases
5. 📝 **Document** insights and key takeaways

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x** - Primary programming language
- **NumPy** - Numerical computing (when needed)
- **Matplotlib** - Data visualization (when needed)
- **Jupyter** - Interactive experimentation (when needed)
