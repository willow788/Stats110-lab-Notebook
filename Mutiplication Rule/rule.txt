Consider a compound experiment consisting
of two sub-experiments, Experiment A and Experiment B.
Suppose that Experiment A has a possible outcomes, and for each of those outcomes Experiment B has b
possible outcomes. 
Then the compound experiment has ab possible outcomes.
To see why the multiplication rule is true, imagine a tree diagram as in Figure 1.2.

Let the tree branch a ways according to the possibilities for Experiment A, and for
each of those branches create b further branches for Experiment B. Overall, there
are b +b+···+b
=ab possibilities
